# Security and Privacy Considerations

This document outlines the security and privacy considerations for the Phone Information Tool.

## Disclaimer

The Phone Information Tool is designed for legitimate purposes such as data validation, information gathering, and educational use. It is not intended for surveillance, stalking, harassment, or any illegal activities. The developer assumes no liability for misuse of this tool.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data is Collected

The Phone Information Tool processes the following data during operation:

- Phone numbers entered by the user
- Basic information derived from phone numbers (country, carrier, type)
- Approximate geolocation information based on phone number prefixes
- Timezone information associated with the phone number's region

### How Data is Stored

- **No Persistent Storage**: The tool does not maintain a database or log of phone numbers or analysis results.
- **Session-Only Processing**: All data is processed in memory during the current session only.
- **Export Control**: Data is only saved to disk when the user explicitly chooses to export results.
- **Local Storage**: All exported files are saved locally on the user's machine in the designated "exports" directory.

### Data Retention

- **Runtime Only**: Phone numbers and analysis results are retained only during the runtime of the application.
- **User-Controlled Exports**: The user has complete control over any exported data files.
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is transmitted to or stored in any cloud service or remote server.

## Internet Connectivity

### When the Tool Connects to the Internet

The Phone Information Tool connects to the internet only for the following purposes:

- Retrieving geolocation information based on phone number prefixes
- Obtaining timezone data for the identified region
- Placeholder for online database searches (not implemented in the current version)

### What Information is Transmitted

- Only the minimum necessary information is transmitted (e.g., country code and area code)
- No personal identifiers are sent with these requests
- No complete phone numbers are transmitted to external services

## Security Practices

### Data Protection

- **No Sensitive Data Storage**: The tool does not store sensitive data between sessions.
- **Local Processing**: Most analysis is performed locally without external services.
- **Export Security**: Exported files contain only the information that was analyzed during the session.

### Secure Communications

- **HTTPS/TLS**: All external API calls use secure HTTPS connections.
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only necessary data is transmitted to external services.
- **No Authentication Required**: The tool does not require user accounts or authentication.

### Input Validation

- **Phone Number Validation**: All phone numbers are validated before processing.
- **Sanitized Inputs**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents security issues from invalid inputs.

## Compliance with Regulations

### GDPR Considerations

The Phone Information Tool is designed with privacy in mind and aligns with GDPR principles:

- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is processed.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data is used only for the stated purpose of phone number analysis.
- **Storage Limitation**: No data is stored beyond the current session unless exported by the user.
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data and any exports.

### Other Privacy Laws

The tool's design also considers other privacy regulations:

- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: No personal information is collected or sold.
- **PIPEDA (Canada)**: The tool respects privacy principles outlined in Canadian law.
- **International Standards**: The design follows international best practices for privacy.

## Acceptable Use

### Legitimate Uses

The Phone Information Tool is intended for:

- Validating phone numbers in datasets
- Educational purposes to understand phone number structures
- Legitimate information gathering with proper authorization
- Testing and development of systems that process phone numbers

### Prohibited Uses

The following uses of the tool are strictly prohibited:

- Stalking, harassment, or surveillance of individuals
- Mass collection of phone number information without consent
- Any illegal activities or violations of privacy laws
- Attempting to identify individuals without proper authorization

## User Recommendations

### Best Practices

- Only analyze phone numbers for which you have legitimate purposes
- Secure any exported files containing analysis results
- Do not share analysis results without proper authorization
- Delete exported files when they are no longer needed

### Privacy Protection

- Use the tool in a secure environment
- Be aware of local privacy laws and regulations
- Consider anonymizing phone numbers in exports if sharing results
- Use the tool's export features responsibly
