# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Phone Information Tool.

## General Questions

### What is the Phone Information Tool?

The Phone Information Tool is a software utility designed to gather and analyze information about phone numbers. It can validate phone numbers, identify their country of origin, carrier information, approximate geolocation, timezone, and more.

### Who developed this tool?

This tool was developed by Saudi Linux. You can contact the developer at SaudiLinuxy7@gmail.com.

### Is this tool free to use?

Yes, the Phone Information Tool is free to use and is distributed under the MIT License, which allows for both personal and commercial use.

### What can I do with this tool?

You can use this tool to:
- Validate phone numbers
- Get basic information about phone numbers (country, carrier, type)
- Find approximate geolocation information
- Determine the timezone associated with a phone number
- Export the gathered information in various formats

## Installation Questions

### What are the system requirements?

- Python 3.6 or higher
- 100 MB of disk space
- 512 MB of RAM
- Internet connection (for geolocation and timezone information)

### How do I install the tool?

The easiest way to install the tool is to:
1. Download the project files
2. Run `setup_venv.bat` by double-clicking it
3. Wait for the installation to complete

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) file.

### Can I install the tool on macOS or Linux?

Yes, the tool can be installed on macOS and Linux. However, you'll need to follow the manual installation process instead of using the batch files. See the [INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for details.

### What dependencies does the tool require?

The tool requires several Python libraries, including:
- phonenumbers
- pytz
- requests
- geopy
- pretty-html-table
- openpyxl
- pandas
- colored

All dependencies are automatically installed when you follow the installation instructions.

## Usage Questions

### How do I run the tool?

You can run the tool in two ways:
1. **Command Line Interface**: Run `run_tool.bat` or execute `python phone_info_tool.py` with the virtual environment activated
2. **Graphical User Interface**: Run `run_gui.bat` or execute `python gui_tool.py` with the virtual environment activated

### What format should I use for phone numbers?

Phone numbers should be entered with the country code, preferably in the international format with a plus sign. For example:
- +966501234567 (Saudi Arabia)
- +12125551234 (United States)
- +447911123456 (United Kingdom)

### Can I analyze multiple phone numbers at once?

The current version of the tool analyzes one phone number at a time. However, you can easily analyze multiple numbers by entering them one after another.

### How do I export the results?

After analyzing a phone number, you can export the results in one of the following formats:
- JSON
- CSV
- Excel
- HTML

In the CLI, you'll be prompted to choose an export format. In the GUI, select the desired format and click the "Export Results" button.

## Performance Questions

### How accurate is the geolocation information?

The geolocation information is approximate and based on the phone number's country code and area code. It provides a general location (usually city or region level) rather than a precise address or GPS coordinates.

### Does the tool work offline?

The tool requires an internet connection to retrieve geolocation and timezone information. Basic validation and country/carrier identification can work offline, but with limited functionality.

### How fast is the analysis?

The analysis typically takes a few seconds per phone number, depending on your internet connection speed and the availability of information for the specific number.

## Privacy and Security Questions

### Does the tool store or share the phone numbers I analyze?

No, the Phone Information Tool does not store, log, or share any phone numbers or analysis results. All processing is done locally on your machine.

### What data does the tool collect?

The tool does not collect any data. It only processes the phone numbers you provide during the current session and does not retain any information after you close the application.

### Is the tool secure to use?

Yes, the tool is designed with security in mind. It runs locally on your machine and does not expose your data to external services except when retrieving geolocation and timezone information from public APIs.

### Can the tool be used for illegal activities?

The tool is designed for legitimate purposes such as data validation, information gathering, and educational use. Using the tool for illegal activities, harassment, or privacy invasion is strictly prohibited and against the terms of use.

## Customization Questions

### Can I modify the tool for my own needs?

Yes, the tool is open-source and can be modified according to your needs. Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING_EN.md](CONTRIBUTING_EN.md) file for guidelines on modifying the code.

### Can I integrate the tool with my own application?

Yes, you can use the tool as a library in your own Python applications. See the [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) file for details on how to integrate the tool with your projects.

### Can I change the export formats?

The current version supports JSON, CSV, Excel, and HTML export formats. If you need additional formats, you can modify the `export_results` method in the `PhoneInfoTool` class.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### The tool fails to install. What should I do?

If you encounter issues during installation, try the following:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed
